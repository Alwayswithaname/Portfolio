# William Palulovitz's Portfolio

this project required me to try new things and **give up** on ideas that wouldnt work or didnt have a satisfying look. **If i were to re build this prodject I would have a better understanding on where and how to start, how and why things break, and a better understanding of scope and time frame.** I am currently satisfyed with how the project looks but look forward to being able to creating a higher quality page.
